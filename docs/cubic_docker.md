# Instructions for installing the cubicSvr image

1. Send your AWS account id to Cobalt to grant you permission to the appropriate repo

2. Authenticate with the image repository in aws:

   `aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --registry-ids 494415350827`

   This will return an auth token for docker that is valid for 12 hours. (There are other ways of authenticating, but this seems to be the easiest.  See [the ECR documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html#registry_auth) for alternatives or if you run into trouble.  You might also need to change your region to us-east-1 before you call get-login.)

3. Copy, paste and execute the whole line that's returned from the get-login command. You can even do this on a different machine if you want to install on a box that doesn't have the AWS CLI.  It will look something like this:

   `docker login -u AWS -p someridiculouslylongtoken https://4944-1535-0827.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
 
4. Pull the image that includes the model you want (either 8kHz or 16kHz)

   `docker pull 494415350827.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cubicsvr-demo-en_us-8`

   OR

   `docker pull 494415350827.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cubicsvr-demo-en_us-16`

5. Start the cubic service listening:

   `docker run -p 2727:2727 -p 8080:8080  -name cobalt 494415350827.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cubicsvr-demo-en_us-16`

   That will start listening for grpc commands on port 2727 and http requests on 8080, and will stream the debug log to stdout.  (BTW, you can replace -name cobalt with whatever name you want.  That just provides a way to refer back to the currently running container.)

6. Verify the service is running by calling 
   `curl http://localhost:8080/api/version`

   There are [4 API endpoints](API.md).  One of them, StreamingRecognize, requires a stream input, so it must either use websockets or grpc, and therefore canâ€™t be called using curl.

7.  If you want to explore the package to see the model files etc,
   `docker exec -it cobalt bash`
   opens the bash terminal on the previously run image.  Model files are located in the /model directory.
