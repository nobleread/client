The public-facing SDK layer for Cobalt Speech engines

## gRPC and Protocol Buffers (protobuf)

Cobalt Speech employs the use of gRPC and Protocal Buffers to provide easy integration with a variety of programing languages.  
For more information on these technologies, please see their respective documentation.

Here are the main documentation links for Protocol Buffers
* https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/
* https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/tutorials
* https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protobuf-runtime-installation
* If you are wanting more info on the genral concepts:
  * https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview

Here are the main documentation links for gRPC
* https://grpc.io/docs/
* If you are wanting more info on general concepts:
  * https://grpc.io/docs/guides/index.html
  * https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html

You will need their runtime libraries installed for each language you wish to use.

## Example SDKs

To help get you started quickly, we have provided the source code generated by `protoc` and a simple client wrapper in various languages.
Please see their respective readme files for more information on the specific details of setting up for that language.

* C++
* Go
* Java
* Python.

## API Overview

Detailed documents on the API can be found [in the docs folder](./docs) For those looking for a brief overview, please continue reading.

The API provides basic information via:
  * `Version()` returns both the server version as well as the cubic ASR engine's version.
  * `ListModels()` returns a list of deployed ASR models and their meta-data.

Apart from this basic information, there are two ASR calls provided:
  * `Recognize()` is generally used as a syncronous call sending the entire audio clip in one call.  This should only be used with short audio files (<1 min). 
  * `StreamingRecognize()` is generally used as an asynchronous call sending portions of the audio clip individually.

When gRPC generates source code, it provides both a synchronous and an asynchronous version of both of these calls.  Please refer to the example clients provided for examples of how to use these methods in each language.
