# Cubic: Cobalt's Automatic Speech Recognition engine

The Cubic engine processes audio into written text using one of the following API calls:
  * `Recognize()` is generally used as a synchronous call sending the entire audio clip in one call.  This should only be used with short audio files (<1 min). 
  * `StreamingRecognize()` is generally used as an asynchronous call sending portions of the audio clip individually.
  
Details on the full API can be found [in the docs folder](./docs). These gRPC APIs can be called using their HTTP fallback, but it is recommended to call them using the gRPC protocol and protocol buffers (protobuf) for serialization because it is a more efficient binary protocol.

SDKs are provided in different languages to simplify making either synchronous or asynchronous gRPC API calls.  Please refer to the sample clients provided for examples of how to use these methods in each language.

## Example SDKs

To help get you started quickly, we have provided the source code generated by `protoc` and a simple client wrapper in various languages.  Please see the readme file in each folder for more information on the specific details of setting up for that language.

## gRPC and Protocol Buffers (protobuf)

Cobalt Speech employs the use of gRPC and Protocol Buffers to provide easy integration with a variety of programing languages.  For more information on these technologies, please see their respective documentation.

Here are the main documentation links for Protocol Buffers
* https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/
* https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/tutorials
* https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protobuf-runtime-installation
* For more information on general concepts:
  * https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview

Here are the main documentation links for gRPC
* https://grpc.io/docs/
* For more information on general concepts:
  * https://grpc.io/docs/guides/index.html
  * https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html

You will need their runtime libraries installed for each language you wish to use.
